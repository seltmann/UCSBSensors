README

Quickstart if you already have python in your system

To start: you must "pip install arable" to install the arable python client

Put "physics.py" in a suitable place in your path to access these helpful functions

The notebook .ipynb can be opened in the Jupyter environment.  

Arable uses homebrew Python version 2.7 but I have used it with python 3 ok so far 

sensor_includes.py needs to include your password information with variables:
email = 'account email'
password_ccber = 'account password'
tenant_ccber = 'account tenant'
